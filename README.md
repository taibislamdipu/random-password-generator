## Random Password Generator

A random password generator is a tool that creates a strong and unique password for you to use when creating accounts or accessing sensitive information online. These passwords are often difficult for humans to remember, but are secure against dictionary attacks and other common forms of cyber attacks.

To use a random password generator, you simply need to provide some basic information, such as the desired length of the password and any specific characters or symbols you want to include. The generator will then create a password for you based on this information.

You can use a random password generator to create passwords for your various accounts, including your GitHub account. This can help protect your personal and professional information from being accessed by unauthorized users.

It's important to note that you should never share your passwords with anyone, and you should always make sure to use a different password for each of your accounts to further increase security.
